📄 `README.md` for GUI-Based Java Calculator

🧮 Java Swing Calculator

This is a simple GUI-based **Calculator** built using **Java Swing**. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

🚀 Features

- Graphical User Interface using Java Swing
- Supports: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Button click interaction for digits and operations
- Input validation for common edge cases (e.g., divide by zero)
- Error handling for invalid input

🛠 Technologies Used

- Language: Java  
- UI Library: Swing (`javax.swing`)  
- Layouts: `BorderLayout`, `GridLayout`  
- IDE: VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub  

 🖥 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-using-java.git
   cd calculator-using-java

2. Compile the Java file:
